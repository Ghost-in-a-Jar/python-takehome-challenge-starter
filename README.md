Python Takehome Challenge Starter
===========

This project is a simple **cookiecutter template** for fast setup when doing take-home challenges. Just
use cookiecutter and create a new project in no time.

Using this template will get a (python 3.12) poetry project with a simple CLI entrypoint and a dockerfile to run the project in a container.

```shell
# If pipx is not installed, see https://github.com/pypa/pipx for Linux and Windows instructions
brew install pipx

# if cookiecutter is not installed
pipx install cookiecutter

# using cookiecutter // linux/Mac
cookiecutter https://github.com/Ghost-in-a-Jar/python-takehome-challenge-starter

# answer the prompt and you're done!
```
